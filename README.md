## **Instructions**

1. **Open the console** in the `Hangman` folder.

2. **Run the game**:
   - Type `node index.js` and press Enter.

3. **Choose a category**:
   - Select either **Movies** or **Games** by typing your choice.

4. **Start guessing**:
   - Guess a letter, or feel free to use a rare character if you prefer.

5. **Fill in the word**:
   - Try to guess the entire word before the hangman emoji is fully drawn.

6. **Watch out for mistakes**:
   - If you make too many incorrect guesses, the hangman emoji will complete, and you'll lose the game.

7. **Continue or Exit**:
   - When asked if you want to continue, type **y** to keep guessing in the same category.
   - Any other input will exit the game and show your stats.
