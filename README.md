Instructions
Open the console in the Hangman folder.

Type node index.js and press Enter.

Choose either movies or games by typing your selection.

Guess a letter, or use a rare character if you prefer.

Try to guess the entire word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.

If you make too many incorrect guesses, the emoji will complete, and you'll lose the game.

When asked if you want to continue, type y to keep guessing within the same category.

Any other input will exit the game and display your stats.

Have fun and good luck!
